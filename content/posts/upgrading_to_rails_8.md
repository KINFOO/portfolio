I was seeking the best way to handle OAuth 2 in a Rails application. I was
learning about wide spread _Devise_ library and then came to realize:
_OAuth 2_ is available right out of the box with _Rails 8_.

Saddly we had started our project with _Rails 7_. To access elegant _OAuth 2_,
I had to upgrade to _Rails 8_[^1].
