## Forge the web

At _Forge the Web_ goal is to deliver a new product.

My position in the organization is using my expertise to provide guidance to
reach product MVP.

When I say expertise, it is _Test Driven Development_, _software architecture_,
_continuous development_, _testing_, _release process_,
but also forecast on _risks_ involved in some features or sub products.

**Technologies involved:** Ruby on Rails, Git, Docker, Docker-compose,
Github Actions, PostgreSQL

## [Smart and Connective](https://smartandconnective.com/)

When I arrived at _Smart and Connective_, the company was migrating to V2.

As part of this effort, I mainly implemented _NestJS_ API & _NextJS_ frontend.
I was also very involved in mentoring juniors, with pair programming and code
reviews. I was aslo in charge of deployments and monitoring products in
production.

**Technologies involved:** Typescript, NestJS, NextJS, Docker, Kubernetes,
Git, GitLab, PostgreSQL

## [AirVantage](https://www.sierrawireless.com/iot-services/smart-connectivity/iot-cloud-platform/)

I spent quite some time on this project, where I was part of a senior team.

I mainly worked on frontend, but my position also required backend and devops.
I often presented our team work and was also picked for duty team.

**Technologies involved:** Typescript, React, Figma jQuery, ExpressJS, Docker,
Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CI, CD, Python, AWS, Java, Kubernetes,

## [Lua Development Tools](https://eclipse.dev/ldt/)

This project was based on my internship work.

The idea was to leverage the work done in
[Metalua](https://github.com/fab13n/metalua) &
[DLTK](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/EclipseDLTK) to provide an IDE for
[Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html). I tokenized Lua code into AST, then AST
was transformed for DLTK to provide navigation, code completion and refactoring
features.

**Technologies involved:** Java, Junit, Eclipse, Lua, Metalua, DLTK, Git,
GitHub, Gerrit, Computer Language Theory, Jenkins, CI, CD, Python
